# 🧨 Contributing to DupeKiller

Welcome, brave soul. If you're here to contribute, you're either a genius, a masochist, or both. This project is minimalist, efficient, and allergic to nonsense. Proceed accordingly.

## 🧼 Code of Conduct

Before you write a single line of code, read the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Violations will be handled with swift, silent judgment and possibly a passive-aggressive emoji.

## 🛠️ How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the Repo

Because you don’t have push access. Yet.

### 2. Clone Your Fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dupekiller.git
```

### 3. Create a Branch

Name it something useful. Not `fix-stuff` or `lol-bug`.

```bash
git checkout -b fix/duplicate-detection-logic
```

### 4. Make Your Changes

- Keep it minimal. This is DupeKiller, not BloatBuilder.
- Follow existing code style. If you don’t know what that is, read the code until you do.
- Write comments only if they prevent existential dread.

### 5. Test It

If your code breaks something, we’ll find you. And we’ll send you a strongly worded email in Comic Sans.

### 6. Commit Properly

```bash
git commit -m "Fix: improved duplicate detection for edge cases"
```

Extended descriptions are welcome. Poetry is tolerated. Vague nonsense is not.

### 7. Push and Open a Pull Request

Be clear. Be concise. If your PR title is “Update stuff,” it will be closed with prejudice.

## 🧪 What We Accept

- Bug fixes that actually fix bugs  
- Features that don’t compromise minimalism  
- Refactors that reduce complexity  
- Documentation that doesn’t read like a ransom note  

## 🚫 What We Reject

- Feature creep  
- Unnecessary dependencies  
- Code that looks like it was written during a caffeine blackout  
- Pull requests that include unrelated changes “just because”  

## 🧙 Final Notes

DupeKiller is a tool for people who care about precision. If you want to contribute, bring your best. If you want to argue about tabs vs spaces, take it to the void.

We appreciate your effort. Even if we don’t show it. Especially if you follow the rules.
