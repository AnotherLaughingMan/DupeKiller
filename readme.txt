DupeKiller
==========

DupeKiller is a lightweight GUI utility for identifying and removing duplicate files based on filename patterns. Designed for simplicity and speed, it helps clean up cluttered directories with minimal fuss.

Features
--------

- Manual folder selection via dialog
- Duplicate detection using filename pattern matching (e.g. "* - Copy*")
- Scrollable preview of detected duplicates
- File deletion with optional dry-run mode
- Dry-run toggle to simulate deletion safely
- Color-coded feedback:
  - Red for deleted files
  - Orange for dry-run previews
- Log file creation with timestamp
- Option to auto-open log file after deletion
- Footer labels showing version and duplicate count

Why filename-based?
-------------------

DupeKiller uses filename pattern matching instead of hash or byte-level comparison. This decision was driven by a specific—and frustrating—real-world problem:

Microsoft OneDrive often creates unnecessary file copies rather than overwriting existing ones. Instead of syncing cleanly, it litters your folders with duplicates like "file - Copy (1).txt", "file - Copy (2).txt", and so on. These aren't true duplicates in content—they're just redundant clutter.

DupeKiller was built to target this mess directly. By focusing on predictable filename patterns, it offers a fast, no-nonsense way to clean up what OneDrive left behind—without the overhead of hashing or deep file inspection.

Installation
------------

DupeKiller is distributed as a standalone .exe built with PyInstaller. No Python installation or dependencies required.

1. Download the latest release from the Releases page
2. Run DupeKiller.exe

Usage
-----

1. Launch the application
2. Select a folder to scan
3. Review the list of detected duplicates
4. Toggle dry-run mode if desired
5. Click "Delete" to remove duplicates or simulate deletion
6. View the log file for details

Known Issues
------------

- No undo functionality after deletion
  Once files are deleted, they’re gone. Use dry-run mode to preview before committing.

- False positives possible
  Detection is based solely on filename patterns. Files with similar names but different content may be flagged.

- No recursive folder scanning
  Only the selected folder is scanned—subdirectories are ignored for now.

- UI may freeze briefly during large scans
  Performance is generally smooth, but very large directories may cause temporary lag.
